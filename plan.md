# Sustainability Hackathon


## Timetable for the day?
10 - 5
2x speakers. 1 more general sustainability + data science, 1 more technical

10-1
1h speaker general
2h introductory coding

1h lunch break

2-5
1h speaker technical
1.5h hack
.5h wrap up

## Part 1

1
costs of research computing
- programmer time/effort
- processor time/energy
- data centre water
- …

2.1
how to estimate carbon footprint of the code
demo: NetworkX / betweenness centrality on a random network?
* look at Chris’s profiling materials?
- is there a simple equation?
- show more sophisticated tools (codecarbon etc?)
exercise: Train MultiLayerPerceptron (neural network) for regression task -> 
investigate how performance increases with number of layers / size of layers …investigate how carbon increases with number of layers / size of layers …

2.2
how to estimate carbon footprint of LLM use including copilot?
- estimate using single query (ideally copilot?)

3
* which approaches / packages will help with memory usage / runtime?
?using vectorised computations in python
?sparse vs dense matrices trade off
?using parallelisation where appropriate

4
* introduce hackathon task
You are given some data about houses and their prices
Your task is to 
estimate energy use of development
competition to determine most efficient code (train and test workflow)

5
how to set up github codespace for reproducibility



## Part 2

Hack…

Competition / results / discussion (development cost?)
