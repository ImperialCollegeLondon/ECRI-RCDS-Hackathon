We provide Research Computing and Data Science courses. You can find [more by clicking here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/).

## Theme - Code Performance and Sustainability

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

- Recall coding and algorithm concepts in terms of modulize coding, time complexity and visualization.

- Able to explain code performance and sustainability concepts.

- Apply W&B (wandb), psutil, codecarbon to track code performance and apply AI-assisted programming skills.

- Able to analyze the code performance.

- Able to develop / create optimized solutions, balancing environmental cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

## Carbon footprint estimation

- Emissions: 

    - C = Carbon Intensity of the electricity consumed for computation: quantified as g of COâ‚‚ emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity.

    - E = Energy Consumed by the computational infrastructure: quantified as kilowatt-hours.

    - CO2eq = C * E


- Generative AI usage:
    - [Use this site to estimate](https://huggingface.co/spaces/genai-impact/ecologits-calculator)


## Quickstart: create a GitHub Codespace from this repo:

https://codespaces.new/ImperialCollegeLondon/ECRI-RCDS-Hackathon?quickstart=1


Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the **green `Code`** button again, then select the Codespace, click `Open`, then `Open in Browser`.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click `Download` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the course notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.
