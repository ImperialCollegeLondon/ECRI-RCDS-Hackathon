- Select the most important features associated with sale price from the house price data.

- Naïve method is loop-based method to calculate the correlation of each column with the sale price.

- Optimized method is (vectorized computational method?) with pandas corrwith() function.

## Sustainability

- Based on estimation of emissions for naïve method and optimized method, observe the sustainability of the code.
